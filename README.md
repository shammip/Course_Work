# Computer Science Projects

These are some projects that I created in each course: 
* [Reinforcement Learning Model (AI)](reinforcement_learning_model.ipynb)
* [Histopathologic Cancer Detection (AI)](histopathologic_cancer_detection.ipynb)
* [Compressive Strength of Concrete (Data Science)](compressive_strength_of_concrete.ipynb)
    * Created a multi-linear regression model to predict concrete compressive strength through data cleaning & exploratory data analysis using **Python** libraries: **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Statsmodels**
* [Dictionary (Algorithms)](dictionary.py)
    * Implemented the **Trie Data Structure** in **C++** by creating a dictionary program to insert words manually or from a text file, look up words, autocomplete & autocorrect words
* [RSA (Discrete Structures)](rsa.py)
    * Designed a program in **Python** to securely send and receive messages by creating encryption & decryption keys using Fast Modular Exponentiation, Euclidean & Extended Euclidean Algorithms
* [Image Processing Application (Starting Computing)](image_processing.cpp)
    * Designed a user interface & 10 image processing functions (ex. vignette, clarendon, rotations etc.) in **C++** by taking an image file as input, performing the requested image processing operation & displaying the new image
