# Computer Science Projects

These are some projects that I created in each course: 
* [Compressive Strength of Concrete (Data Science)](compressive_strength_of_concrete.ipynb)
* [Dictionary (Algorithms)](dictionary.py)
* [RSA (Discrete Structures)](rsa.py)
* [Image Processing Application (Starting Computing)](image_processing.cpp)
