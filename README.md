# Computer Science Projects

These are some projects that I created in each course: 
* [Reinforcement Learning Model (AI)](reinforcement_learning_model.ipynb)
   * Utilized **OpenAI's Gymnasium** and **Stable Baselines3** to test many **Reinforcement Learning** (RL) algorithms in **Python** on **Google Colab**. The Lunar Lander environment from OpenAI Gymnasium was tested with RL models that were created using RL algorithms **(A2C, PPO, DQN)**, to determine which model resulted in the highest reward.
* [K-Means Clustering (Data Mining)](kmeans_clustering.ipynb)
    * Applied k-means clustering data mining technique to predict reliabilty of EVSE chargers using **Python** libraries: **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Scikit-Learn**.
* [Multi-Linear Regression Model (Data Science)](multi_linear_regression_model.ipynb)
    * Created a multi-linear regression model to predict concrete compressive strength through data cleaning & exploratory data analysis using **Python** libraries: **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Statsmodels**.
* [Dictionary (Algorithms)](dictionary.py)
    * Implemented the **Trie Data Structure** in **C++** by creating a dictionary program to insert words manually or from a text file, look up words, autocomplete & autocorrect words
* [RSA (Discrete Structures)](rsa.py)
    * Designed a program in **Python** to securely send and receive messages by creating encryption & decryption keys using Fast Modular Exponentiation, Euclidean & Extended Euclidean Algorithms.
* [Image Processing Application (Starting Computing)](image_processing.cpp)
    * Designed a user interface & 10 image processing functions (ex. vignette, clarendon, rotations etc.) in **C++** by taking an image file as input, performing the requested image processing operation & displaying the new image.
